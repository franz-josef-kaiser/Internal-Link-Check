== Description ==
= Internal Link Checker =

Adds a meta box to the post edit screen that shows all internal links from other posts/pages/post-types to the currently displayed post. The plugin works out of the box.


== Installation ==

No explanation needed - works out of the box. Just activate and be safe.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How-to =

By default, the plugin gets this columns from <code>wp_posts</code> table: <code>ID, post_title, post_date, post_content, post_type</code>.
And its Meta Box displays the following: ID, Title and Date.
In case you want to extend its functionality you can use the available hooks

== Master filter ==

Used to modify the SQL query, add the meta box to other post types, add columns to the meta box and set the sortable ones
<pre>
function internal_links_master_function( $args, $context )
{
	switch ( $context )
	{
		# Modify the columns retrived from the database
		case 'sql':
			return array( 'ID', 'post_title', 'post_date', 'post_content', 'post_excerpt', 'post_type' );
		break;
		# Add Meta Box to other post types
		case 'metabox':
			return array( 'post', 'page' );
		break;
		# Add columns to the metabox
		case 'columns':
			$columns = array(
				 'ID' => 'ID'
				,'post_title' => 'TÃ­tulo'
				,'post_date'  => 'Fecha'
				,'post_type'  => 'Tipo'
				,'post_excerpt'  => 'Resumo'
			);
			return $columns;
		break;
		# Set Meta Box sortable columns
		case 'sortables':
			$sortable = array(
				 'ID' => array( 'ID', true )
				,'post_title'  => array( 'post_date', true )
				,'post_date'  => array( 'post_date', true )
				,'post_type'  => array( 'post_type', true )
			);
			return $sortable;
		break;
	}
	return $args;
}

function internal_links_apply_filter()
{
	add_filter( 'internal_links_master_filter', 'internal_links_master_function', 10, 2 );
}
add_action( 'admin_init', 'internal_links_apply_filter', 10 );
</pre>

function posts_per_page_ilc($number) 
{
    return 8;
}
add_filter( 'internal_links_per_page', 'posts_per_page_ilc' );
</pre>
